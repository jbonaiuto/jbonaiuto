abstract = {Although it is established that F5 neurons can distinguish between nonsocial goals such as bringing food to the mouth for eating or placing it in a container, it is not clear whether they discriminate between social and nonsocial goals. Here, we recorded single-unit activity in the ventral premotor cortex of two female macaques and used a simple reach-to-grasp motor task in which a monkey grasped an object with a precision grip in three conditions, which only differed in terms of their final goal, that is, a subsequent motor act that was either social (placing in the experimenter's hand [â€œHandâ€ condition]) or nonsocial (placing in a container [â€œContainerâ€ condition] or bringing to the mouth for eating [â€œMouthâ€ condition]). We found that, during the execution of the grasping motor act, the response of a sizable proportion of F5 motor neurons was modulated by the final goal of the action, with some having a preference for the social goal condition. Our results reveal that the representation of goal-directed...},
