# Biography

I am a postdoctoral researcher in neuroscience at the Institut des Sciences Cognitives - Marc Jeannerod, CNRS. My research interests include motor control, action-based decision making, and cortical beta activity. I have recently obtained an ERC Consolidator Grant (ECoG-2019) to study sensorimotor beta bursts in terms of mechanisms, functional role, and development. I'll soon be hiring at all levels. Contact me with expressions of interest.
