The use of subject-specific head-casts allows for acquisition of high SNR MEG data. Using computer simulations I showed that with these head-casts it is, in principle, possible to localize data recorded with MEG sensors to deep or superficial cortical laminae; a possibility that I then realized, non-invasively in the human brain, demonstrating the laminar- and frequency-specific correlates of action selection for the first time.
